# Entropy Generation

Paralink provides [hardware based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator) source of entropy for use in smart contracts.

Unlike the real world data ingress, the entropy generation is a **trusted** service. We believe that having stronger guarantee of true randomness from inherently stochastic, natural processes is more valuable than a quorum based, potentially weakly seeded pseudo-random process.

Paralink Entropy as a service can also be used as a seeding mechanism for 3rd party PRNG's.
