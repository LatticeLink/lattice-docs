# Problem Statement

Smart contracts are undoubtedly great at immutable storage and verifiable transactions. However, their use cases have previously been quite restricted.The main reason for this is that **most blockchains are not aware of anything going on in the real world**, nor can they access any data not native to the chain itself.

This includes any data available on the traditional web, as well as those accessible through APIs. When you start to consider just how much of the tools we use today depends on those data, the problem becomes quite apparent.

While many attempts at solving it have been made, the current solutions are too expensive and brittle to be useful at scale.
