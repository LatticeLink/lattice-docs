# Summary

Lattice Link is a **real world data ingress for cross chain applications**. Its purpose is to collect, validate, aggregates and interpolate real-world datasets and feed them into smart contracts on Ethereum and Polkadot.

Lattice's flexible node design allows developers to **query data** including real-world events, sports, weather, random numbers and more. Developers can create custom queries using **Lattice Query Language**  and connect smart contracts with traditional web APIs within minutes.

Applications that require the highest degree of security can use Lattice **on-chain consensus** algorithm, running on Polkadot Substrate. This makes the coordination much cheaper than performing the same computation on Ethereum.

Lattice entropy as a service provides high quality **hardware based randomness**.
