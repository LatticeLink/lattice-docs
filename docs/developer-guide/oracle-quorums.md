# Oracle Quorums

Oracle quorums are a blockchain based solution. Our implementation is done with Polkadot Substrate.

The oracle quorums are self-organizing groups of oracle providers. All answers to oracle requests
undergo automatic on-chain validation and aggregation. The final result (if accepted) is delivered
with XCMP or over the Bridge by the relayers.

_Note: The Oracle Quorums, Relayers, XCMP and Bridges are cutting edge technologies, undergoing
active development. At the moment, this solution is not yet suitable for production use._

**Example use cases:**
 - Accurate, real-time pricing data feeds for leveraged derivatives and money markets
 - Regular, cross-chain state synchronization

The oracle quorums are currently available on the [Developer Testnet](/developer-guide/testnet).
